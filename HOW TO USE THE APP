🚀 Getting Started: Your First Secure Transmission
Follow these steps to send and verify a Level 2 (Quantum AES) encrypted message:

1. Configure Your Identity
Before sending, you must link the terminal to your mail provider:
Open the Key Configuration menu from the sidebar.
Enter your Email Address and your Gmail App Password (standard passwords will not work due to SMTP security).
Click Save Configuration. The terminal will now remember your identity for future sessions.

2. Compose and Encrypt
Enter the Recipient's Email, a Subject, and your message in the Payload box.
Select Quantum AES-256 (Level 2) from the Security Protocol dropdown.
Click Send Encrypted.
What happens behind the scenes: The app silently fetches a high-entropy key and a unique Key ID from the KMS Simulator, encrypts your text, and transmits the secure packet.

3. Decrypt and Restore
To test the receiver side, copy the DATA string from the received email or your Encrypted Outbox.
Paste that string back into the Message Payload box in the main terminal.
Ensure the Security Protocol is still set to the level used for encryption.
Click the Inbox button in the sidebar.

The terminal will use the active session key to restore the plaintext and display a DECRYPTION_SUCCESS notification.

🛡️ Forensic Verification Test
To prove the security of the transmission, paste that same DATA string into the QuMailInterceptor tool.
Click Attempt Brute Force.
You will see that while the tool can identify the packet, it cannot recover the message because it lacks the Quantum Key associated with that specific transmission.
